        <h2>A Little Bit About Me...</h2>
        <p>My name is Ashley and I am currently a Graphic Designer and Digital Marketer. I studied Visual Arts at Fordham University in New York City and graduated with a BA. Since then, I have worked at Sotheby's International Realty on their marketing team and have moved to various brokerages around the country. I currently manage the Digital Marketing Team at Realogics Sotheby's Internatiional Realty which consists of four specialists who oversee 50+ client accounts.</p>
        <p>I have been in Seattle for 4 years and love it here! I am currently enrolled at Code Fellows and am hoping to mix my background in design with development skills in order to create both visually stunning and highly functional programs and websites.</p>
